### About it
It's a `Web app` to find and report lost pets around your area. Made using `HTML`, `css` and `typescript` for the `frontend`. 
For the backend i use `typescript` and `Node.js`, also `Postman` again to test each `endpoint` and create a documentation.

The main library of the project is `Mapbox`, and the `database` used for this project was `Heroku postgre` (`SQL`).
